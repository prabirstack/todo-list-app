# React.js-based to-do list application

## 1. Project Overview:

- The project aims to develop a web-based to-do list application using React.js.

- Integration with external services (e.g., cloud storage, authentication) is out of scope.

## 4. Deliverables:

- Functional React.js-based to-do list application.
- Documentation outlining key components, architecture, and usage instructions.

## 5. Milestones:
